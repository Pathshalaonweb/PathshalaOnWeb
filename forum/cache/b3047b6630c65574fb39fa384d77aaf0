The eXtreme Programming or XP methodology is a project management method that applies the principles of agile development to the extreme, i.e. Extreme programming (XP) is considered the most radical form of agile software development, which is why it’s called “extreme.” There is probably no other methodology as agile as XP, least of all traditional programming practices. <br> <br> <br>Extreme Programmers constantly communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. <br> <br>Extreme Programming is one of Agile methodologies. It shares all Agile principles including strong customer involvement in the software development process, good communication inside of the teams, and iterative cycles of development. <br> <br>What are the roots of Extreme Programming? <br> <br>• Communication: Everyone on a team works jointly at every stage of the project. <br> <br>They keep their design simple and clean.

Extreme Programming is probably the most effective method of software development. <br> They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. <br> <br>The difference between this approach and more conventional system development methods is the focus on designing and coding for the needs of today instead of those of tomorrow, next week, or next month. Extreme Programming encourages starting with the simplest solution and refactoring to better ones. Some more specific takes on SDLC include: There is only one core principle underlying Extreme Programming that I can see: The form and functionality of the program being developed should grow at the same rate as the programmer's and customer's understanding of the application. Values and Principles of Extreme Programming XP has simple rules that are based on 5 values . They deliver the system to the customers as early as … The above principle is not expressed as clearly I would like it, but it will do for now. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:30:"extreme programming principles";s:5:"links";s:2814:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

It contains a number of large and important rivers. Brahmaputra river takes a south ward turn around Namcha Barwa and enter in Arunachal Pradesh. Now, coming to the river Brahmaputra and Indus, it is Brahmaputra which is longest than Indus. Average elevation at which the Indus flows through JK is about 4000 m above sea level. It is joined by the Zaskar River at Leh (these kind of points are important for prelims). Geography of Asia: Asia is the largest continent of Earth. <br> <br>Brahmaputra river is joined by two tributaries Dibang from the north and Lohit river from the south. The weather is a cold and harsh climate. The attenuation of river flow due to the melting of snow in the river Brahmaputra basin affects the downstream discharge of the river. I was reading the geography of class viii standard (assamese medium) for exam preparation then i found this line in this book (Translation: chemayungdung glacier is the origin of river Brahmaputra.) A seldom-run river, the Brahmaputra offers beautiful scenery, excellent big white water and great wild life in a less-visited corner of the sub-continent. Total length of the Brahmaputra river is about 2,900 km. Here it first flows under the name of Siong and then as the Dihang. The origin of Indus river is the Tibetan plateus near Manas Sarovar. This increase in discharge due to the significant retreat of snow gives rise to severe catastrophic problems such as flood and erosion. Brahmaputra River has its history of flow through the dense forests and tribal settlements. From Sadiya (Assam Valley) onwards, it is known as Brahmaputra river. <br> Question: What is the origin of the Indus and Brahmaputra Rivers? The Ganges was ranked as the fifth most polluted river of the world in 2007. <br> <br> <br> <br>Why so? Near Skardu, it is joined by the Shyok at an elevation of about 2,700 m. It is one of the longest rivers of Asia. Pollution threatens many fish species and amphibian species and the endangered Ganges river dolphin (Blind Dolphin). It flows through Jammu and Kashmir in the western direction until it reaches Pakistan, and from there it takes southern course to merge with Arabian Sea. The gradient of the river in J&K is very gentle (about 30 cm per km). The longest river within India is Ganga, not Brahmaputra.

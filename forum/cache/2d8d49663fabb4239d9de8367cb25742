Functional programming languages are declarative, meaning that a computation's logic is expressed without describing its control flow. There are several sub-paradigms of the declarative programming paradigm, such as the functional or the logic programming paradigms. The opposite of imperative.  Declarative programming is a method to abstract away the control flow for logic required for software to perform an action, and instead involves stating what the task or desired outcome is. From the definition of the Declarative Programming: Characteristics of declarative languages: Model of computation based on a system where relationships are specified directly in terms of … This paradigm emphasizes the concept of what to dorather than how to do it. Instead, programmers use expressions to tell the computer what needs to be done, but not how to accomplish the task. In declarative programming, the solution path to reach the goal is determined automatically. This works well, provided the specifications of the final state are clearly defined and an appropriate implementation procedure exists. What makes EJB components special is the declarative programming model through which we can specify the services such as security, persistence, transaction etc., that the container should provide. Declarative programming is a contrast programming paradigm compared with imperative programming. At runtime, the container uses the metadata specified … I draw the line between declarative and non-declarative at whether you can trace the code as it runs. Declarative programming is like when you ask your friend to write an essay, you don’t care how does he write it, you just want to get the result. In the declarative programming paradigm, you describe a result or a goal, and you get it via a " black box ". An EJB only implements the business logic; the services are associated through a deployment descriptor, which essentially acts as metadata for the EJB. In declarative programming, there are no statements. If both of these conditions are met, declarative programming is very efficient.

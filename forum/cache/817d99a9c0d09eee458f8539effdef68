Capillary chemistry definition is - a branch of physical chemistry that is concerned with phenomena in very small pores sometimes including adsorption, absorption, catalysis, and colloid chemistry. Capillary Action. As the water evaporates from the surface of the leaves, water from the lower levels that is the roots are drawn up by this phenomenon. </p> <p>Capillary Action Definition. This spontaneous rising of a liquid is the outcome of two opposing forces: Cohesion – the attractive forces between similar molecules or atoms, in our case the molecules or atoms of the liquid. </p> <p>Return to top of page. </p> <p>Want chemistry games, drills, tests and more? Capillary action also has many other applications in physics, chemistry, as well as in everyday life. When capillary tube is dipped in a liquid, the liquid level either rises or falls in … </p> <p>Capillary Action Key Concepts. Cohesion holds the water molecules together, while adhesion helps the water molecules stick to glass or plant tissue. Glossary of chemistry terms . </p> <p>Was this definition helpful? You need to become an AUS-e-TUTE Member! </p> <p>Define capillary action. </p> <p>The capillary action is what causes the movement of groundwater through the different zones of soil.  Capillary Action Key Concepts. </p> <p>It is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, and sometimes in opposition to, external forces like gravity. Intermolecular forces also cause a phenomenon called capillary action, which is the tendency of a polar liquid to rise against gravity into a small-diameter tube (a capillary), as shown in Figure \(\PageIndex{3}\).When a glass capillary is is placed in liquid water, water rises up into the capillary. Capillary action is an interesting phenomenon that helps plants raise water without requiring motion. Capillary action can cause corrosion. The startling rise of a liquid in a narrow tube is called capillary action or simply, capillarity. In the following sections, we shall try to understand capillary action and its working. Related Terms & Definitions. </p> <p>Search the Dictionary for More Terms. But that isn’t all. For example, rain water, laden with chloride, typically runs over a roof and is discharged into the gutters. Also called capillary action, capillary attraction. </p> <p>capillary action The tube which has small internal diameters is called capillary tube. As the water evaporates from the surface of the leaves, water from the lower levels that is the roots are drawn up by this phenomenon. </p> <p>a manifestation of surface tension by which the portion of the surface of a liquid coming in contact with a solid is elevated or depressed, depending on the adhesive or cohesive properties of the liquid. 1) The drawing of a liquid up the inside of a small-bore tube when adhesive forces exceed cohesive forces, or the depression of the surface of the liquid when cohesive forces exceed the adhesive forces. </p> <p>Capillary action at the overlapped joint tends to pull water under the upper roof sheet, holding it there as it slowly dries out and concentrates the amount of chloride in the joint. How the fluids are transported inside the xylem vessels of plants is also by the capillary action. Capillary action is also known as capillarity, capillary motion, or wicking. </p> <p>With time, this can cause pitting corrosion, leading to failure of the roof panels. </p> <p>The capillary action is what causes the movement of groundwater through the different zones of soil. Capillary action is defined as the movement of a fluid within a capillary, a narrow tube, due to the forces of cohesion and adhesion.

a:5:{s:8:"template";s:0:"";s:4:"text";s:1893:"He did an outstanding job and is a great football coach," Dantonio said. Michigan State‘s stellar season defensively in 2017 gave the Spartans the 7th overall defense in the country; co-defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach Harlon Barnett was sure to be hot commodity during the coaching carousel.. Two days after Mel Tucker was named Michigan State’s new head coach, he reached out to Harlon Barnett on Feb. 14 and asked if he would like to join his staff. We wish Harlon and his family all the best as he continues his coaching career." Mike Tressel (born September 28, 1973) is an American football coach who was most recently the defensive coordinator and interim head coach for the Michigan State Spartans. “I would like to thank Harlon Barnett for his 14 years working on our staff, including all 11 years at Michigan State.  The phone call didn’t last long. Barnett played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) as a safety for seven seasons with the Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Minnesota Vikings.In his career, Barnett had four interceptions, all with New England. Tressel, the nephew of former Ohio State head coach Jim Tressel, joined the University of Cincinnati's football coaching staff under Mark Dantonio in 2004. The man delivering that hit is Harlon Barnett, back then a Michigan State defensive back who would go on to enjoy a seven-year run in the NFL before embarking on a career in coaching. So far Mel Tucker’s staff at Michigan State looks a lot like Mark Dantonio’s 2019 staff, but that could be changing. Harlon T. Barnett (born January 2, 1967) is an American football coach and former player. Well, sort of. Tucker has hired two assistant coaches–that we know of–and both were a part of Mark Dantonio’s 2019 group of assistants, defensive line coach Ron Burton and former defensive coordinator Mike Tressel.

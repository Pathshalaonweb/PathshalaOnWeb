a:5:{s:8:"template";s:0:"";s:4:"text";s:5510:"<br>The name hemoglobin comes from heme and globin, since each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein with an embedded heme (or haem) group.Each heme group contains an iron atom, and this is responsible for the binding of oxygen. There are approximately 300 million haemoglobin molecules in each red blood cells. Hemoglobin forms an unstable reversible bond with oxygen. In the lungs, 1 g of hemoglobin combines readily with 1.36 cc of oxygen by oxygenation to form oxyhemoglobin. Examples: chromo-proteins: haemoglobin in which prosthetic group is iron phospho-proteins: casein in milk: in which prosthetic group is phosphoric acid 7.5.2 Outline the difference between fibrous and globular proteins, with reference to two examples of each protein type. In the tissues where oxygen concentration is low and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration is high (low pH), hemoglobin releases its oxygen. In their normal shape, red blood cells are round with narrow centres similar to a doughnut without a pickle in the centre. ; These amino acids combine with each other to form peptide chains. Red blood cells do not have a nucleus, increasing the amount of space for haemoglobin. <br> <br>It carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissue cells, and carbondioxide- the gaseous waste -from the cells to the lungs. The function of a protein depends on its three dimensional shape, therefore makes hemoglobin a protein. These proteins are called conjugated proteins. <br> <br>Option: (c) Explanation: Haemoglobin is an iron containing protein, where there are "chains of amino acids" attached to each other with the help of peptide bonds. Haemoglobin is made up of globular protein and an iron- rich compound known as haem. Haemoglobin - binds to oxygen to transport it around body; Haemoglobin. Globular Proteins. Information and translations of conjugated protein in the most comprehensive dictionary definitions resource on the web. <br> <br>Hb is a conjugated protein present in RBCs. a. In the case of haemoglobin, the conjugated group is an Fe ion contained in a heterocyclic organic molecule. Its function is to carry oxygen around in the blood, and it is facilitated in doing so by the presence of the haem group which contains a \(\text{Fe}^{2+}\) ion, onto which the oxygen molecules can bind. Which of these will not normally denature a protein? What does conjugated protein mean? Simple proteins comprise amino acid units, held together by peptide bonds. Upon hydrolysis they can yield only the amino acids from which they are made. The best known globulins, insoluble in water, can be extracted from seeds by treatment with 2 to 10 percent solutions of sodium chloride. Protein - Protein - Plant proteins: Plant proteins, mostly globulins, have been obtained chiefly from the protein-rich seeds of cereals and legumes. Myoglobin is a monomeric heme protein found mainly in muscle tissue where it serves as an intracellular storage site for oxygen. <br> <br>Haemoglobin is a type of conjugated protein which plays a significant role in respiration. Quick revise. <br> <br>Hemoglobin (or haemoglobin, frequently abbreviated as Hb), which is contained in red blood cells, serves as the oxygen carrier in blood. Haemoglobin also plays a role in maintaining the shape of the red blood cells. <br> <br>Very high pH b. 9. The haem group in haemoglobin is a prosthetic group. <br> <br>In the oxygenated state, it is called oxyhemoglobin and is bright red; in the reduced state, it is purplish blue. conjugated protein n. Biochemistry A compound, such as hemoglobin, that is made up of a protein molecule and a nonprotein prosthetic group. <br> <br>Protein shape can be categorised as either fibrous or globular. <br> <br>Haemoglobin is a water soluble globular protein which is composed of two α polypeptide chains, two β polypeptide chains and an inorganic prosthetic haem group. <br> <br>This is a smart and a complex system evolved to maintain haemoglobin as a significant biological molecule throughout a long period of time. Haemoglobin and Collagen. Hemoglobin (or haemoglobin, frequently abbreviated as Hb), which is contained in red blood cells, serves as the oxygen carrier in blood. Hemoglobin is a crystallizable, conjugated protein consisting of heme and globin. <br> <br>Haemoglobin is a conjugated protein, because its structure includes conjugated (joined to) non-amino acid groups. Definition of conjugated protein in the Definitions.net dictionary. a. It contains more than one chain c. It binds to oxygen d. It is fixed to the cell membrane. <br> <br>Globular and Fibrous Proteins . Hemoglobin, iron-containing protein in the blood of many animals that transports oxygen to the tissues. The name hemoglobin comes from heme and globin, since each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein with an embedded heme (or haem) group.Each heme group contains an iron atom, and this is responsible for the binding of oxygen. Small amounts of albumins are found in seeds. 8. Myoglobin and hemoglobin are hemeproteins whose physiological importance is principally related to their ability to bind molecular oxygen. It is found in red blood cells and is involved in the transport of oxygen around the body. The non-proteinous substance is called prosthetic group or cofactor. <br> <br>Very low pH c. Very high temperatures d. Very low temperatures.  Why is haemoglobin described as a 'conjugated protein'? Conjugated proteins are composed of simple proteins combined with a non-proteinous substance. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:39:"why is haemoglobin a conjugated protein";s:5:"links";s:5025:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

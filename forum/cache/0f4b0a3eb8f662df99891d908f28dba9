The Doppler Effect induces a shift at each end of the stars spectrum as one limb recedes, while the other is advancing. The component of the radial velocity observed through line broadening depends on the inclination of the star's pole to the line of sight. Spectroscopic Line Broadening- A second method for determining rotational velocities exploits the broadening of stellar spectral lines due to rotation. </p> <p>This web application displays the effect of rotation on the shape, temperature and spectrum of a star. The experimental setup consists in acquiring the emission spectrum of a high pressure sodium lamp. by making use of the fact that the ratio of the first and second zero frequencies (q 2 /q 1) in the Fourier transform of spectral line profiles is a useful indicator. The derived value is given as ⋅ ⁡, where v e is the rotational velocity at the equator and i is the inclination. OVERVIEW. Line broadening in the presence of the protein is often an indicator of protein–ligand interactions. All lines from a galaxy share the red-shift of the galaxy, but Doppler shifts can also arise from motions of objects within the galaxy. Spectral analysis The graph in the question for Part C shows that thermal and from PHYS 1403 at Collin College Doppler shifts can affect all spectral lines.  D. The rotation curve would look the same with or without the presence of dark matter. However, i is not always known, so the result gives a minimum value for the star's rotational velocity. The degree of line broadening depends on many factors, including the transverse relaxation rate, the exchange rate, and the fraction of the ligand in the free and bound state. C. The orbital speeds would rise upward with increasing distance from the galactic center, rather than remaining approximately constant. B. Magnetic or Electrical external fields cause the Zeeman effect or the Stark effect with the splitting of the spectral lines and the final result of causing a broadening of the lines. </p> <p>3. The nature of differential rotation in A-, F-, and G-type stars has been extensively investigated by Reiners et al. This is also known as collisional, or Stark, broadening and is most prevalent in high-density, low-temperature ( n > 10 15 cm −3 , T e ≤ 4 eV) plasmas. In atomic physics, Doppler broadening is the broadening of spectral lines due to the Doppler effect caused by a distribution of velocities of atoms or molecules.Different velocities of the emitting particles result in different Doppler shifts, the cumulative effect of which is the line broadening. </p> <p>Experimental Setup. 6.1 Monitoring Line Broadening. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:69:"how does the rotation of a galaxy result in spectral line broadening?";s:5:"links";s:1675:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

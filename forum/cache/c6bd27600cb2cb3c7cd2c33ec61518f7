In this paper, I am going to explain gravitational time dilation without the knowledge of any other concept such as the equivalence principle and others. It means that the rate at which time "flows" differently for two observers situated near different gravitational masses. Length Contraction The length of any object in a moving frame will appear foreshortened in the direction of motion, ... For small velocities at which the relativity factor is very close to 1, then the time dilation can be expanded in a binomial expansion to get the approximate expression: See also Gravitational time dilation. Gravitational time dilation is a physics concept about changes in the passage of time, caused by general relativity.A clock in outer space moves more quickly than a clock on Earth. GRAVITATIONAL TIME DILATION EXPLAINED FOR BEGINNERS INTRODUCTION At first the concept of gravitational time dilation may look a bit complicated and it is difficult to figure out the reason. In order to attempt to prove this theory of time dilation, two very accurate atomic clocks were synchronized and one was taken on a high-speed trip on an airplane. </p> <p>This means that a clock on a spaceship far away from any planet would move faster than a clock near Earth. How Special Relativity Works. Heavy things like planets create a gravitational field that slows down time nearby. Time Dilation. </p> <p> </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:23:"time dilation explained";s:5:"links";s:1608:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

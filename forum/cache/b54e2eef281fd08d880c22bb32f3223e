Long-period comets (those which take more than 200 years to complete an orbit around the Sun) originate from the Oort Cloud. 4.  Short-period comets (those which take less than 200 years to complete an orbit around the Sun) originate from the Kuiper Belt. A young human being or an animal before birth.7. Explanation: A comet is a celestial body consisting mainly of ice, dust and gas in a (usually very eccentric) orbit around the Sun and having a "tail" of matter blown back from it by the solar wind as it approaches the Sun. <br> <br>The period from fertilization to birth. Answer: They primarily originate from two regions: the Kuiper Belt, and the Oort Cloud. Re believed to have two sources.  The long-period comets originate from the Oort Cloud, while the short-period comets originate from the Kuiper Belt. StarChild Question of the Month for December 2001 Question: Where do comets come from? (The term "astronomical unit" is a measurement, equivalent to the distance between Earth and the Sun.) Most of them are long-period comets and come from the Kuiper belt hope it helps u pls mark me as brainlist answer Sometimes a long-period comet will come in toward the Sun and veer off â€¦ The JFCs are active over a lifetime of about 10,000 years or ~1,000 orbits whereas long-period comets fade much faster. For comets with an orbital period of over 1000 years, see the List of near-parabolic comets. Answer: Comets are believed to have two sources. It is single celled and consists of three parts - a head with a nucleus, a middle piece and a long tail.6. Long-period comets (those which take more than 200 years to complete an orbit around the Sun) originate from the Oort Cloud. Short-period comets (those which take less than 200 years to complete an orbit around the Sun) originate from the Kuiper Belt. The orbital inclinations of comets are usually high and not near the ecliptic where most solar system objects are found. Short-period comets, which orbit the sun in 200 years or less, are usually Kuiper Belt objects, while long-period comets that take hundreds or thousands of years to orbit the sun generally come from the Oort Cloud..6 billion years ago. Only 10% of the long-period comets survive more than 50 passages to small perihelion and only 1% of them survive more than 2,000 passages. Jupiter-family comets and long-period comets appear to follow very different fading laws. The following list is of comets with very long orbital periods, defined as between 200 and 1000 years.These comets come from the Kuiper belt and scattered disk, beyond the orbit of Pluto, with possible origins in the Oort cloud for many. It extends more than 75,000 astronomical units away from the Sun and contains millions of comets. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:36:"long period comets come from brainly";s:5:"links";s:2613:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

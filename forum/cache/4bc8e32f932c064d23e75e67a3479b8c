Softball Biomechanics are essentially the mechanics of our biological movements. A graph of biomechanics is made concerning body part, action, and muscles used in heating the softball. The key body- parts involved … By having labels for movement it is easier to relate the activities to movements and when needing to explain to colleagues. Biomechanics in Softball By Georgia Purnell Conclusion: To conclude, understanding the basic biomechanical techniques can help a player to improve their overall performance, especially after analysing their technique. Bat speed is also another important aspect that is achieved through the biomechanics of hitting the softball. <br> <br>The biomechanics of softball will assist me to better my This paper entails the biomechanics of heating a softball. Table 1: Body Parts, Action, and Muscles Coordination when Hitting a Softball Guided by biomechanics this blog will demonstrate how to pitch a softball consistently accurately and with good speed in order to trouble the opposing batter. The 'windmill' softball pitch is the standard pitching technique as the rules of softball specify that the pitch must be underarm. If the ball was hit at a low trajectory the ball would go along the ground, which would not go as far and could easily be fielded by the opposition. A fast bat speed ensures that the softball comes off the bat equally fast.  This aspect brings in both biological and mechanical activities in the entire process. Blazevich (2012) states that hitting the ball at a projection angle of 45 degrees maximises the distance because there is … The coordination of body parts, action, and muscles is as shown in the table below.

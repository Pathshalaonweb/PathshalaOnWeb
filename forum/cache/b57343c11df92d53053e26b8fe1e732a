Pygmy Hog World's smallest and the rarest Pig An insight into its Biology & Conservation A talk by Deepanwita Purohit Deepanwita Purohit studies the … “It was essential, therefore, that the Pygmy Hog Conservation Programme (PHCP) follows a two-pronged action plan: conservation breeding of the animal against possible early extinction and re-introduction in selected sites, and habitat management,” said the advisor to PHCP, Goutam Narayan. Also, the habitat suited to pygmy hogs is equally crucial for the survival of several other endangered species such as the one-horned rhinoceros, tiger, swamp deer, wild buffalo, hispid hare and Bengal florican.  <br>Pygmy hog natural habitat consists of relatively flat terrain covered in densely packed 2 metre high ‘elephant grass’.

Gestation Period The gestation period of this species is found to be 100 days. Intense deforestation and habitat destruction due to accelerated development of agriculture, overgrazing and fires, led to drastic reduction in the number of pygmy hogs in the wild. The pygmy hog featured in the first IUCN/WWF (1984) list of the 12 most threatened animal species in the world. Simulated environments are important as the hogs need to learn to become independent in as natural a setting as possible before being released. Some management practices, such as planting of trees in the grasslands and indiscriminate use of fire to create openings and to promote fresh growth of grass, have caused extensive damage to the habitats … Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust has launched a comprehensive conservation strategy including field status surveys of pygmy hogs and their habitats, behavioural studies, personnel training, local community awareness and assistance programmes, and the establishment of a highly successful captive-breeding programme at the Pygmy Hog Research and Breeding Centre in Assam. The pygmy hog is one of the the very few mammals that build its own home, or nest, complete with a ‘roof’, but maybe more important than its own attributes, is the fact that it is an indicator species. <br> Its presence reflects the health of its primary habitat, the tall, wet grasslands of the region. Pygmy hog inhabits areas covered with tall, dense grass, mixed scrublands and secondary forests. The population in Barnadi was believed to have been lost by 1981, due to extensive habitat burning, until a small number was rediscovered in 1990. Simulated environments are important as the hogs need to learn to become independent in as natural a setting as possible before being released. To give you an idea of the grassland habitat of the pygmy hog I'm sharing a 40 sec video of me a couple of years ago. <br> <br>Its presence reflects the health of its primary habitat, the tall, wet grasslands of the region. I nearly lost my guide in front when I turned around! <br> <br>They used to be widespread in the tall, wet grasslands in the southern Himalayan foothills from Uttar Pradesh to Assam, through Nepal and north Bengal. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:36:"pixie lott   what do you take me for";s:5:"links";s:4690:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

Persistent organic pollutants and adverse health effects in humans. <br> <br>The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is a multilateral treaty to protect human health and the environment from chemicals, known as POPs. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are considered as the silent killers due to their bio-accumulative and long persistent natures. <br> <br>Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemicals of global concern due to their potential for long-range transport, persistence in the environment, ability to bio-magnify and bio-accumulate in ecosystems, as well as their significant negative effects on human health and the environment. The majority of countries report that POP emissions fell during the period 1990 to 2017. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are semi-vol atile persistent toxic substances that are characterized by significant potential to long-range transport and accumulation in the environmental media.  <br> <br>in soil, air, and/or water, remaining in the environment for long periods of time. Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollutants (LRTAP), Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). hexachlorobenzene (HCB) decreased by 95 %, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by 75 %, dioxins and furans by around 70 % and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by 83 %. <br> <br>POPs have harmful impacts on human health or on the environment. <br> Concerns about the health effects of exposure to POPs arose initially from studies of wildlife communities that showed reproductive, developmental, endocrine, immunologic and carcinogenic effects.13, 14, 15 The wildlife in these communities had high rates of malformed genitalia, aberrant mating behaviour, sterility, cancer, and immune system and thyroid … <br> <br>Land Pollutants <br> <br>Persistent Organic Pollutants - Impact on Child Health 5 I. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are toxic substances that are produced intentionally or are the by-products of various combustion or industrial processes. These are responsible for various lethal diseases and environmental … They remain intact in the environment for long periods, become widely distributed geographically and accumulate in the fatty tissue of humans and wildlife. The use of DDT has now been banned in most countries, and the tendency is to opt for pesticides that degrade rapidly in the environment (FAO, n.d.). These substances break down very slowly (or ?persist?) <br> <br>Because they can be transported by wind and water, most POPs generated in one country can and do affect people and wildlife … Persistent organic pollutants are carbon-based chemicals that persist in the environment for a long time, are damaging to the environment, wildlife, and people, and can be spread over long distances. These are present everywhere in our environment including plants, animals and human beings. There are other air pollutants such as; Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), Airborne particles and Radioactive pollutants. The aim of the Convention is that Parties shall endeavor to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. Print Book & E-Book. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are considered as the silent killers due to their bio-accumulative and long persistent natures. Since 1990, emissions of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) decreased in the EEA-33 countries, e.g. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants came into force on 17 May 2004, with Australia ratifying the Convention on 20 May 2004 and becoming a Party on 18 August 2004.. They bioaccumulate and biomagnify as they move through the food chain. Persistent organic pollutants.

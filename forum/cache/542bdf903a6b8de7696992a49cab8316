The Heidelberg Laureate Forum twitter accountconfirmed that Atiyah is scheduled to announce his work at the forum on Monday. © Heidelberg Laureate Forum Foundation … Mathematician Michael Atiyah presents his claimed proof of the Riemann hypothesis at the Heidelberg Laureate Forum on 24 September. At a hotly-anticipated talkat the Heidelberg Laureate Forum today, retired mathematician Michael Atiyah … Mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah claimed he solved the "most important open problem" in maths, the Riemann hypothesis. <br> <br>Atiyah and the Riemann Hypothesis Posted on September 22, 2018April 29, 2019by Ricardo Let’s get straight to the point: Sir Michael Atiyah announced that he has a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) and will present it in Heidelberg this Monday 24 of September.  One of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics likely remains unsolved.  Michael Atiyah and the Riemann hypothesis This morning I heard rumors that Michael Atiyah claims to have proven the Riemann hypothesis. At the 2018 Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF), Sir Michael Atiyah gave a lecture in which he claimed to have found a proof for the Riemann hypothesis. After Sir Michael Atiyah’s presentation of a claimed proofof the Riemann Hypothesisearlier this week at the Heidelberg Laureate Forum, we’ve shared some of the immediate discussion in the aftermath, and now here’s a round-up of what we’ve learned. At a lecture in Germany on Monday he presented his solution, which needs to be published and reviewed before he can claim a $1 million prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:22:"michael atiyah riemann";s:5:"links";s:1742:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

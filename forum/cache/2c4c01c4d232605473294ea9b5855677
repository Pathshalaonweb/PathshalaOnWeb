A common type of binary tree is a binary search tree, in which every node has a value that is greater than or equal to the node values in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to the node values in the right sub-tree. It is important to note that a binary tree can have no children (leaf node), 1 child or 2 children. Binary Tree representation . 2. In this representation, the binary tree is stored in the memory, in the form of a linked list where the number of nodes are stored at non-contiguous memory locations and linked together by inheriting parent child relationship like a tree. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child. In this example depth of a binary tree Is the total number of edges (3), thus the depth of BT= 3. Simply you have to count the longest path of BTâ€™s edges for calculating the depth of a node. This tree consists of zero or more nodes. Important Terms Following are the important terms with respect to tree. The difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree is binary trees are not ordered whilst a binary search tree is ordered. Binary Tree Data Structure A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. A tree like this is called a binary search tree or BST. Linked Representation. Please do not get confused between a binary tree and a binary search tree.. Another important application of binary tree is information coding, such as Huffman coding 2, used in lossless data compression, encryption and decryption.  In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. There are two types of representation of a binary tree: 1. For example, this is a binary search tree containing some words (ordered by dictionary ordering): This is another BST containing the same values: We haven't made any assertions about the BST being balanced or full. There are two things to calculate in a binary tree, first is the depth of a BT (binary tree) and the second is the height of a BT. Example 1. No other cases are possible. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:42:"an important application of binary tree is";s:5:"links";s:3149:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

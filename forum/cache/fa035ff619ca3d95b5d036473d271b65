When they arrived at Emmaus Jesus made as if to go on further, but the two disciples held him back. 1. Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus In the 1930s, the painting Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus was certified as a genuine 17th cen- tury Vermeer by a noted art historian, A. Bredius and bought by the Rembrandt Society. </p> <p>The Supper at Emmaus is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, executed in 1601, and now in London.Originally this painting was commissioned and paid for by Ciriaco Mattei, brother of cardinal Girolamo Mattei.. When the disciples arrive at Emmaus, they invite the stranger (Christ) to stay with them. And then everything ended abruptly. There is not yet recognition by the disciples. This comes from commentaries in the D-R Bible by Haydock. Christ shows up in the most unexpected places — in the wisdom of a stranger, in the breaking of bread and even in those moments when all hope seems lost. </p> <p>Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus by Rembrandt Harmens Van Rhine The Biblical Gospel paintings of the early Rembrandt are imbued with a stormy movement, filled with excessive pathos. Times before. Some of Jesus’ disciples also felt that way after the crucifixion. The one remained unnamed, and Cleopas remains unknown except for his name. Jesus starts by saying that the disciples couldn't figure it out on their own—what the prophets had already spoken (Luke 24:25). Jerome said that the house of Cleophas was made into a Church that was still standing in the year 400.  After His cruel and brutal death on the cross, they were disappointed with God.

Now it is true that we all—and each one of us—would like to know which Scriptures the Lord quoted which spoke about Him, by which they were kindled, strengthened, and convinced. Luke 24:13-35 declares that Jesus appears after his resurrection to two disciples who are walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus, which is described as being 60 stadia (10.4 to 12 km depending on what definition of stadion is used) from Jerusalem. In this final chapter of Luke’s Gospel, we read of two disciples (Cleopas and one unnamed) of Jesus who were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day that Jesus rose from the dead.As they traveled, a man joined them—the resurrected Jesus, although they did not recognize Him. A third instance is when the two disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35) did not recognize Jesus until He broke bread. Question: "What happened on the road to Emmaus?" Their lives were burning with anticipation for the day when Christ would establish His kingdom. 13 ¶And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. The disciples experienced the Divine Liturgy on the road to Emmaus. At this moment, the disciples immediately recognize him, but then he suddenly vanishes from their sight. Answer: The events on the road to Emmaus are discussed in Luke 24. The answer to this question is not as uncertain as most people, who are accustomed to referring merely to the “Emmaus disciples,” are likely to assume.

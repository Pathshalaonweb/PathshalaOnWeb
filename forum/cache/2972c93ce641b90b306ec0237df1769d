The home of Eritrean Afar people, in the southern tip of Eritrea bordering the Red sea, Djibouti and Ethiopia, is going through calamities where the basic food has become scarce. -usually has a very strong magnetic field-sometimes appears as a pulsar Black hole:-size defined by its Schwarzschild radius-viewed from afar, time stops at its event horizon The following items describe observational characteristics that could indicate that an object is either a white dwarf or a neutron star. Once you get inside, the laws of physics as we know it cease to exists, and new laws are put into place. </p> <p>Supported by electron degeneracy pressure 3. viewed from afar, time stops at its event horizon 4. sometimes appears as a pulsar 5. size defined by its Schwarzchild radius 6. has a mass no greater than 1.4M Sun 7. usually has a very strong magnetic field 8. in a … … It has its event horizon at a Schwarzschild radius distance from the center of the black hole. From Unlucky’s perspective, however, their clock is running normally and Lucky’s is running fast. Concerning the limit as an object approaches the event horizon: what is the limit of a dipole as the distance between the poles tends toward zero? Chapter 18 Homework 15 The Bizzare Stellar Graveyard Flashcards Preview ... view from afar, time stops at its event horizon size defined by its schwarzschild radius. Match each characteristic to the correct object. The list goes on like this: * Unlike the misconception; Black holes do not suck - Black holes look like they're sucking in matter from all around.  </p> <p>Time dilation also rears its ugly head when you consider the time frame of a distant observer. We found ways to break it down into usable numbers and figures to figure out when it is best to have breakfast lunch and dinner. has a mass no greater than 1.4 Msun supported by electron degeneracy pressure in a binary system, it can explode as a supernova, </p> <p>From that perspective, in-falling matter will seem to freeze in time just as it reaches the event horizon. 8 Distortion Of Light, Space, And Time. Astro 150 Spring 2019: Lecture 17 page 15 Astro 150 Spring 2019: Lecture 17 page what lies beneath? Think of a black hole that is non-rotating and just sits there. The black hole warps time and space so much that Unlucky’s time appears to be running slower. That limit is that of a monopole. The region is historically known as Dankalia though almost two-decades ago it was renamed the Southern Red Sea region by the ruling party of Eritrea. However the fall down to the singularity intuitively would seem to release an infinite energy, if the potential is still reverse proportional to the radius. $\begingroup$ The logic in the comment above works fine up to the event horizon where time stops for a remote observer. •non-rotating: d < rs •fall @ speed of light to form a singularity •viewed from afar, collapse stops at event horizon • Cosmic Censorship •time stops → loses meaning → is irrelevant! And to those who say time is a man made concept, so it has no effect. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:49:"viewed from afar, time stops at its event horizon";s:5:"links";s:5695:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

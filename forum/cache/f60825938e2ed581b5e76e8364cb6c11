a:5:{s:8:"template";s:0:"";s:4:"text";s:2455:"<p></p> <p>Je Tsongkhapa, whose ordained name was Losang Dragpa, was a great 14th century Tibetan Buddhist Master who promoted and developed the Kadampa Buddhism that Atisha had introduced three centuries earlier. Since the time of the 5th Dalai Lama in the 17th century, his personage has always been a symbol of unification of the state of Tibet, where he has represented Buddhist values and traditions.  The following is extracted from a talk given by Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso on Je Tsongkhapa Day 1996 at Manjushri KMC. Almost right around the time that I started back, there was another Je Tsongkhapa empowerment. The Je Tsongkhapa Kadampa Buddhist Center in Asheville is a  a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization under Kadampa Meditation Center South Carolina (KMC SC),  whose aim is to help the general public to develop inner peace by offering meditation classes and practical Buddhist advice suitable for … </p> <p>Je Tsongkhapa referred to his monastic order as "the New Kadam." Buddha Shakyamuni predicted him in King of Instructions Sutra , explaining that he would spread and clarify Buddha’s teachings of Sutra and Tantra and prevent people from following mistaken views. His appearance in Tibet had been predicted by Buddha himself. In 1991, Kelsang Gyatso founded a new religious movement he named the "New Kadampa Tradition - International Kadampa Buddhist Union" (NKT-IKBU). After Je Tsongkhapa, the New Kadampa lineage flourished for hundreds of years, down to the present day. Je Tsongkhapa Day October 25 is Je Tsongkhapa Day, when we remember the great kindness of Je Tsongkhapa. The daily practice or puja offered at Bodhisattva KMC is Heart Jewel which includes special prayers and requests to our Spiritual Guide, Je Tsongkhapa combined with the condensed prayer to his Dharma Protector and a guided meditation on Lamrim (stages of the path to Enlightenment.) </p> <p>In recent years, it has been promoted widely throughout the world by the contemporary Buddhist Master, Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. </p> <p>This one was without Shugden. </p> <p>The term Gelug came into use only after his death. </p> <p>Gen Thekchen will be guiding the 21 Lamrim meditations within the practice of Heart Jewel. When quarantine started, I went back to Kadampa and joined their streaming classes and went back to the Foundation Program. Je Tsongkhapa was a Tibetan Buddhist Master and scholar who founded the New Kadampa lineage. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:21:"je tsongkhapa kadampa";s:5:"links";s:3283:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

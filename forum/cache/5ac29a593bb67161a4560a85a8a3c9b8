Ngāi Tahu Farming manages eight dairy farms at Te Whenua Hou which is 40km northwest of Christchurch. The Ngāi Tahu Claim Ngāi Tahu and the South Island. Above water is taken to mean survival and progress; below water is suffering death. The rebuilding and recovering for the iwi continues, just as it does for the city of Christchurch, and the resilience shown by both are inspiring. We are reminded of this by our Ngāi Tahu Farming whakataukī: Explore our Ngāi Tahu Atlas to view over 1,000 original Māori place names of Te Waipounamu. We are now back on campus after a period of lockdown. An inter-generational network of traditional Māori travel routes throughout Te Waipounamu . However Ngāi Tahu and Ngāi Tūāhuriri have used this settlement and the autonomy and self-determination to retain their mana as individuals, as hapu, and as an iwi. Ngāi Tahu whakapapa (genealogy) binds us to the mountains, land, forests, and waters. Calls for the conservation board to be sacked or members replaced were echoed by some West Coast council leaders. But within decades, the government obtained vast tracts of Ngāi Tahu lands, paying a fraction of their worth and failing to deliver promised benefits of the purchases. The largest of these was the Canterbury purchase of 1848, negotiated by Henry Tacy Kemp, which saw 20 million acres (about 8 million hectares) sold for £2,000. Ngāi Tāmanuhiri is a Māori iwi of New Zealandand were formerly known by the name of Ngai Tahu, and Ngai Tahu-po respectively. They are descendants of Tahu-nui (also known as Tahu potiki, or Tahu matua) who is also the eponymous ancestor of the Kai Tahu iwi of Te Waipounamu. Its takiwā is the largest in New Zealand, Te Rūnanga o Arowhenua. Before 1840, Ngāi Tahu held rights over much of Te Wai Pounamu (the South Island). Read about our people. The South Island Landless Natives Act 1906 eventually provided 50 acres a person to be awarded to landless Ngāi Tahu. Additionally, a range of legislative tools including a Right of First Refusal, a Deferred Settlement Purchase arrangement, and a mechanism for future Relativity Payments, were enacted to help the tribe re-establish its economic base. The takiwa centres on Arowhenua and extends from Rakaia to Waitaki, sharing interests with Ngai Tuahuriri ki Kaiapoi between Hakatere and Rakaia, and thence inland. Underpinning this unique relationship is the belief that the natural environment sustains us, and in turn, we have a responsibility to nurture the environment through the generations. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:16:"ngāi tahu lands";s:5:"links";s:2948:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

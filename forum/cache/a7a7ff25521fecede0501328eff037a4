Describe the properties of magnetic poles. In that case, the iron pieces arrange themselves in a pattern similar to that shown in the accompanying photograph. The stronger the effect of the ligands then the greater the difference between the high and low energy d groups. It can be an electric current in a conductor or charged particles moving through space, or it can be the motion of an electron in an atomic orbital.Magnetism is also associated with elementary particles, such as the electron, that have a property called spin. </p> <p>Question 1 A permanent magnet is a device that retains a magnetic field without need for a power source. Differentiate between a non magnetic and magnetic substances.

In certain areas of the country and the world, catching rainwater for household use is the only cost-effective solution. Rainwater harvesting refers to the trapping and storing of rainwater so that it can be used at a later time when the need arises. The short answer is yes, there is a connection between using a rainwater harvesting system and energy sustainability efforts. Rainwater harvesting is the practice of collecting rainwater for small scale irrigated agriculture or plumbing/drinking/food preparation/cleaning purposes. UK rainwater harvesting system suppliers commonly use short-hand methods when designing storage tanks for their systems (ref 10). Rainwater harvesting is a strategy of collection and storage space of rainwater into natural reservoirs or tanks, or the seepage of surface water into subsoil water channels. <br> This simple method can put forward a solution which will be workable in areas where there is sufficient rain but the groundwater supply is not sufficient on the one hand and on the other surface water resource is insufficient . Rainwater that is captured and stored correctly is a safe, economical and sustainable source of quality water. <br> <br> <br> <br>There are different ways in which this task can be accomplished. There are, however, more detailed models better suited to the design of RWH systems and their performance and these are researched in 'Rainwater Harvesting: Model based design-evaluation' (Ward, et al., 2010). The short answer is, yes, rainwater harvesting systems can deliver a good return on investment. Favorite Answer. Often the water is collected from a house, barn or other roof and channeled into barrels, tanks or underground or basement storage cisterns through a series of drain pipes. Rainwater harvesting (also called roofwater harvesting) involves the collection, storage and distribution of rainwater from the roof, for use inside and outside the home or business.  <br>Rainwater harvesting or the collection of rainwater in a proper way, can be a permanent solution to the problem of water crisis in different parts of the world. There is a direct correlation between saving water and saving energy. Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting rainwater and putting it to good use. It is one of the purest form of water found on earth, because it is collected after it has vaporized and is almost as good as distilled water. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:41:"what is rainwater harvesting short answer";s:5:"links";s:3484:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,

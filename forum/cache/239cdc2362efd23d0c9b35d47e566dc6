Psychology should inform the creation, implementation, and compliance (or lack thereof) with law.  <br>Psychology and law is an extremely broad topic area that includes many basic and applied research areas; applied topics in mental health, memory, and jury behavior; and evaluation of laws and legal processes. •Psychology is important in counselling. The legal community understands the importance social psychological factors play -- Many law schools require their students take courses on it. Law is about the regulation of human behavior; psychology is the study of human behavior. More generally, psychological researchers can impact the law in a variety of ways. Psychological science, knowledge and expertise may indeed contribute to promoting effective law enforcement behaviors and strategies. Adapted from the Encyclopedia of Psychology The relationship between psychology and law As Wells (2002) suggested the criminal justice system would do well to acknowledge the psychologists involved in investigating eyewitness testimony; as they can do for the justice system what the justice system cannot, namely conduct scientific experiments that isolate cause-effect relationships. Workplace psychology principles can also help employers understand how to hire for particular traits … Knowing these could help the employer draft appropriate job descriptions and advertisements, and look for these qualities throughout the interview process. Although law and psychology are two separate fields, they are united by their interest in human behavior. How people’s perceptions, misperceptions, and cognitive biases can affect criminal investigations and court room outcomes. Professionals in this field are often given the sinister responsibilities of trying to figure out why certain types of people commit crimes; what type of person commits a crime; and how to prevent people from committing crimes.  While psychology’s goal is to understand behavior and law’s goal to regulate it, both fields make assumptions about what causes people to act the way they do. Jonathan Kitchen/Digital Vision/Getty Images According to Ronald Riggio, Ph.D., of Claremont McKenna College, the study of psychology is important to explain basic human behavior, apply critical decision and thinking skills, improve interpersonal communication and provide a background for the business sector. <br> This field of psychology is often focused on the criminals themselves. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:27:"dumbbell set with rack 5 25";s:5:"links";s:2412:"<a href='https://www.pathshala.co/forum/page.php?id=d7382a-'></a>,
